# Product Listing Application
Built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS) 

## Overview

The MERN Products Application is a full-stack web app that makes it easy to manage a product inventory with simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and deployed on Render, itâ€™s designed to be both functional and user-friendly.

This project is an attempt of mine to dive into the essentials of full-stack development.

## Key Features

- Create Products: Add new products to the inventory with relevant details.
- Read Products: View a list of all products or search for specific products.
- Update Products: Modify details of existing products.
- Delete Products: Remove products from the inventory.

- Deployed on Render: The application is deployed and can be accessed live.
